# Hilbert–Schmidt Inner Product
Suppose $V$ is a vector space, all linear operator in $V$ is in $L_V$. It is obvious to see that  $L_V$ is also a vector space and for the linear operators, we define a function $\left( \cdot,\cdot\right)$ on $L_V\times L_V$:
$$(A,B)\equiv tr(A^\dagger B)$$
It is an inner product function and known as _Hilbert–Schmidt_ or _trace_ inner product.
