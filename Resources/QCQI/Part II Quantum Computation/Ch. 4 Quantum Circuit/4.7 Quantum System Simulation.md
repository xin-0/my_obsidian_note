# Overview
The key challenge in simulating quantum systems is the exponential number of differential equations which must be solved.

# Important Quantum Systems 
- Ising Model
	- $$H=\sum_{k=1}^n{\vec{\sigma}_k\cdot\vec{\sigma}_{k+1}}$$

# Quantum Simulation Algorithm 
The heart of quantum simulation algorithms is the following asymptotic approximation theorem:
## Trotter formula
>Let $A$ and $B$ be Hamiltonian operators. Then for any real $t$, $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(e^{iAt/n}e^{iBt/n})^n=e^{i(A+B)t}$$

Based on reasoning similar to the proof to Trotter formula, it can be shown that 
$$\tag{1}e^{i(A+B)\Delta t}=e^{iA\Delta t}e^{iB\Delta t}+O(\Delta t^2)$$
and
$$\tag{2}e^{i(A+B)\Delta t}=e^{iA\Delta t/2}e^{iB\Delta t}e^{iA\Delta t/2}+O(\Delta t^3)$$

## Algorithm
### Inputs
1. __ A Hamiltonian:__ $\bf H=\sum_kH_k$ acting on an $N$-dimensional system, where each $H_k$ acting on a small subgroup of size independent of N.
2. __An Initial state:__ $\bf \ket{\psi_0}$ of the system at $t=0$
3. __A positive, non-zero accuracy:__ $\bf \delta$
4. __A time:__ $\bf t_f$ at which the evolved state is desired.
### Outputs
__A state__ $\ket{\tilde{\psi}(t_f)}$ such that $\vert\bra{\tilde{\psi}(t_f)}e^{-iHt_f}\ket{\psi_0}\vert^2\ge1-\delta$

### Runtime
$O(poly(1/\delta))$ operations

### Procedure
>Choose a representation such that the state $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}$ of $n=poly(\log N)$ qubits  approximates the system and the operators $e^{-iH_k\Delta t}$ have efficient quantum circuit approximations. Select an approximation method, (1), (2) or any other methods. Choose $\Delta t$ such that the expected error is acceptable and $j\Delta t=t_f$, construct the corresponding quantum circuit $U_{\Delta t}$ and do:
>1. Initialize:
>$\ket{\tilde{\psi}}\leftarrow\ket{\psi_0};j=0$
>2. Loop: 
>$\ket{\tilde{\psi}_{j+1}}=U_{\Delta t}\ket{\tilde{\psi}_{j}}$
>$j=j+1$  ;  goto $2$ until $j\Delta t\ge t_f$
>3. Result:
>$\ket{\tilde{\psi}(t_f)}=\ket{\tilde{\psi}_{j}}$



[^1]: Moreover,just as there exist unitary operations which cannot be efficiently approximated, it is possible in principle to imagine quantum systems with Hamiltonians which cannot be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Of course, we believe that such systems aren’t actually realized in Nature, otherwise we’d be able to exploit them to do information processing beyond the quantum circuit model.
