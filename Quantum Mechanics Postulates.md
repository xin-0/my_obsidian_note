## Postulate 1
Key idea: State Space in Math <--> Physical World
> The __state space__ of an isolated physical system is a Hilbert Space. The system is completely described by state vector, an unit vector in the state space

### Remark:
- Qubit is a math object.
- we need such postulate since QM does not tell us the state space of the system.


## Postulate 2
Key idea: how quantum mechanical systems evolve in time
> The evolution of a __closed__ quantum system is described by a __unitary transformation__. If the system is in state $\mid\psi\rangle$ at $T=t_1$ and in state $\mid\psi^{'}\rangle$ at $T=t_2$, then two states are related with an unitary operator $U$ by:
> $$ \mid\psi^{'}\rangle = U\mid\psi\rangle$$
> where $U$ only depends on $t_1$ and $t_2$.

### Remark:
- $U$ can be any unitary that can be realized in realistic systems, e.g.:
	- [[Pauli Matrices]]
	- [[Hadamard Gate]]
- "Closed": it is not insteracting with other systems

__Revied Version__ of Postulate 2: for _continuous time_
> A closed quantum system evolve in time according to SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
> $$i\hbar{d\mid\psi\rangle\over dt}=H\mid\psi\rangle$$
- $H$ is [[Hamiltonian]], a Hermitian operator
