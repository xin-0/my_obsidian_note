# Polar Decomposition
## Polar decomposition Theorem
>Let $A$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$ . Then there exists unitary $U$ and positive operators $J$ and $K$ such that
$$A=UJ=KU$$
where $J\equiv\sqrt{A^\dagger A}$ and $K\equiv\sqrt{AA^
\dagger}$
Moreover, if $A$ is ivertable then $U$ is unique.

We call the expression $A = UJ$ the left polar decomposition of $A$, and $A = KU$ the right polar decomposition of $A$.

# Singular value Decomposition
>Let $A$ be a square matrix. Then there exist unitary matrices $U$ and $V$ , and a diagonal matrix $D$ with non-negative entries such that
>$$A=UDV$$
>The diagonal elements of $D$ are called the _singular values_ of $A$
