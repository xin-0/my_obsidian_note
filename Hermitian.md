Definition:
A matrix whose conjugate transpose is itself, i.e.
$$H^\dagger=H$$

Property:
- Diagonal entries are real
- Hermtian is [[Normal Matrix]]
- a Hermitian matrix has all real eigenvalues and the orthogonal eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues.
- $H$ is Hermitian implies $H^{-1}$ is Hermitian
- $A, B$ are Hermitians implies $(A+B)$ is Hermitian.
- For any complex vetor $\vec v$, $\vec v^T H \vec v$ is real. 
- determinant of a Hermitian is real
