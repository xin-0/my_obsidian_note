## Commutator
_Commutator_ between two operators $A$ and $B$ is defined to be
$$[A,B]=AB-BA$$
if $[A,B]=0$, i.e. $AB=BA$, we say $A$ commutes with $B$

## Anti-Commutator
_Anti-Commutator_ between two operators $A$ and $B$ is defined to be
$$\{A,B\}=AB+BA$$
we say $A$ anti-commutes with $B$ if $\{A,B\}=0$

## Properties
1. $[A,B]=-[B,A]$  ^d04c3b
2. $[A,B]^\dagger=[B^\dagger,A^\dagger]$ ^d0091f
3. $A,B$ are Hermitians $\implies i[A,B]$ is Hermitian 

## Simultaneous diagonalization theorem
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are Hermitians. Then $[A,B]=0$ if and only if there exits an orthonormal basis such that both $A$ and $B$ are diagonal with respect to that basis. We say that $A$ and $B$ are simultaneously diagonalizable in this case.
