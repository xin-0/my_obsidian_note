## Other Candidates
---
Difference from [[Superconducting Qubit]]. Spin qubits operates in silicon.

## Adavantages
---
Advantages amongs models for qubits from [article](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-sees-promise-silicon-spin-qubits-quantum-computing/#gs.b0cz08):
1. __Smaller pysical size__ thus promising for building chips containing milliions of qubits but still small in size. Expect to have __long coherence time__
2. Can function at __higher temperatures__ than superconducting qubits, 1 K vs 0.02K.
3. __Manufacture technique__ can be developed from current silicon transistor technology. 

## Some Terminologies
---
transistor: a switch controlling the electron flow between two contacts using voltage

Gate: can locally pull or push away an electron depending on the polarity of the voltage that we apply to the gate

Coulomb blockade:
when "line" is lower than fermi energy on both sides, current is blocked.


## Architecture
---
How do we know that individual charges are being added to the island?

1. The standard method is to look at the current that flows between the contacts through the [[quantum dot]] â€“ the central island.
	==process??==
	- when $\mu_S>\mu(N)>\mu_D$,  current flows
		- energy needed for an electron to enter the quntum dot: 
		$$m(n)=\mu(N)-\mu(N-1)$$
2. Charge sensing:
