- a derivative of charge qubits
- looks like one capacitor + one inductor
- quantized[[ LC oscillator]], (not exact)
	- confined the number of energy levels of LC oscillator to 2
- In a transmon, the inductance is provided by a Josephson junction and not by a typical coil inductor. This disrupts the harmonic energy spectrum and helps confine the system to two levels.

### Operations on Transmon
- requires [[Transmission-Line Resonator]]
