- a derivative of charge qubits
- looks like one capacitor + one inductor
- quantized[[ LC oscillator]], (not exact)
	- confined the number of energy levels of LC oscillator to 2
- In a transmon, the inductance is provided by a Josephson junction and not by a typical coil inductor. This disrupts the harmonic energy spectrum and helps confine the system to two levels.

### [[Operation on Qubits]]- Transmon
To perform operations on transmon, it requires [[Transmission-Line Resonator]] to form a [[Circuit QED]] such that the qubit can interact with outside world.

	- two qubits couple through a common resonator
