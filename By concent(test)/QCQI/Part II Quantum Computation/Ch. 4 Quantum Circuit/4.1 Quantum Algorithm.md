## Why are there so few quantum algorithms known which are better than their classical counterparts?
Design good quantum algorithm is HARD:
- algorithm design in general, classical or quantum, is not easy
	- Even harder for designing quantum algorithm since we want it to be better than the best known classical ones.
- Our intuitions are more adapted to the classical world than the quantum.

# Tools for describing quantum algorithm
==__Quantum Circuit__==:
assemblies of discrete sets of components which describe computational procedures

## Advantages of using quantum circuit
- enable us to quantify the cost of algorithm in terms of:
	1. number of gates
	2. circuit depth
- simplifies algorithm design by coming with a toolbox of tricks
- provides ready conceptual understanding
