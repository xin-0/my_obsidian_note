# Facts
- It is known that $BPP\subseteq BQP\subseteq PSPACE$ but whether $BQP\neq BPP$ is not clear, which is crucial for proving $BPP\neq BQP$.
- there may be some slight advantage in using three-level quantum systems (qutrits) over two-level systems, any difference will be essentially negligible from the theoretical point of view


# Possible Criticism
The basic assumptions underlying the state space and starting conditions in the quantum circuit model are not justified.
- __State Space__
	- Might there be anything to be gained by using systems whose state space is infinite dimensional?
- __Starting Condition__
	- It might be that having access to certain states allows particular computations to be done much more easily than if we are constrained to start in the computational basis.
- __Measurement__
	- Can we perform entangling measurement other than just entangling unitary operations and use it for circuit design?
