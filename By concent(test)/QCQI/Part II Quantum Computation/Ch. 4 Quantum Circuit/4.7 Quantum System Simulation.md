# Overview
The key challenge in simulating quantum systems is the exponential number of differential equations which must be solved.

# Important Quantum Systems 
- Ising Model
	- $$H=\sum_{k=1}^n{\vec{\sigma}_k\cdot\vec{\sigma}_{k+1}}$$



sidenote [^1]

[^1]: Moreover,just as there exist unitary operations which cannot be efficiently approximated, it is possible in principle to imagine quantum systems with Hamiltonians which cannot be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Of course, we believe that such systems aren’t actually realized in Nature, otherwise we’d be able to exploit them to do information processing beyond the quantum circuit model.
