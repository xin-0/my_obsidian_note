# Path
CNOT + single-qubit unitaries $\rightarrow$ universal set for QC
product of two-level unitary $\rightarrow$ an arbitrary unitary

some two-level unitaries can be viewed as single qubit operation. Combining these facts, we can prove the universality of "CNOT+single-qubit unitary"

# Approximation
## Discrete sets
The set of unitary operations is continous. We can't implement an arbitrary unitary exactly. But with a discrete set of gates, we can approximate to arbitrary accuracy.
### Define metric
#### error
When $U$ is the target unitary and $V$ is the actual unitary implemented, the error is defined as:
$$E(U,V)\equiv\max_{\ket\psi}{\Vert(U-V)\ket\psi\Vert}$$
### Two discrete sets for universal QC
These two are the only discrete sets known so far(2020) that with univaersality can build fault-tolerant quantum circuit.  
- Hadamard + phase + CNOT + $\pi/8$ gates
- Hadamard + phase + CNOT + Toffoli

## HTH
$m$ gates requires $O(m^2/\epsilon)$

# Solovayâ€“Kitaev theorem
$O(m\log^c{(m/\epsilon)})\qquad c\approx2$
