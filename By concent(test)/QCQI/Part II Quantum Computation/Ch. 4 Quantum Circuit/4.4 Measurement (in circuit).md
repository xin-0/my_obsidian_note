# Principles
## Principle of deferred measurement
> Measurements can always be moved from an intermediate stage of a quantum circuit to the end of the circuit; if the measurement results are used at any stage of the circuit then the classically controlled operations can be replaced by conditional quantum operations.

## Principle of implicit measurement
> Without loss of generality, any unterminated quantum wires (qubits which are not measured) at the end of a quantum circuit may be assumed to be measured.

In order for a measurement to be reversible, it must reveal no information about the quantum state being measured.
