transistor: a switch controlling the electron flow between two contacts using voltage

Gate: can locally pull or push away an electron depending on the polarity of the voltage that we apply to the gate

Coulomb blockade:
when "line" is lower than fermi energy on both sides, current is blocked.

How do we know that individual charges are being added to the island?

1. The standard method is to look at the current that flows between the contacts through the [[quantum dot]] â€“ the central island.
	==process??==
	- when $\mu_S>\mu(N)>\mu_D$,  current flows
		- energy needed for an electron to enter the quntum dot: 
		$$m(n)=\mu(N)-\mu(N-1)$$
2. Charge sensing:
