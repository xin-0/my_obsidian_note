# Commutator
_Commutator_ between two operators $A$ and $B$ is defined to be
$$[A,B]=AB-BA$$
if $[A,B]=0$, i.e. $AB=BA$, we say $A$ commutes with $B$

# Anti-Commutator
_Anti-Commutator_ between two operators $A$ and $B$ is defined to be
$${A,B}=AB+BA$$
we say $A$ anti-commutes with $B$ if ${A,B}=0$
