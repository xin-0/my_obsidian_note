# Outer Product
$\ket{w}\bra{v}$ is a linear operator from $V$ to $W$:
$$(\ket{w}\bra{v})\ket{v'}=\ket{w}\braket{v|v'}=\braket{v|v'}\ket{w}$$

Suppose $A:W\rightarrow V$ is a linear operator, use [[Completeness Relation]] twice we can write it as outer product:
$$\begin{align}A&=I_WAI_V \\
			    &=\left(\sum_j{\ket{w_j}\bra{w_j}}\right)A\left(\sum_i{\ket{v_i}\bra{v_i}}\right) \\
	    &=\sum_{ij}{\ket{w_j}\bra{w_j}A\ket{v_i}\bra{v_i}} \\
		&=\sum_{ij}{\bra{w_j}A\ket{v_i}\ket{w_j}\bra{v_i}}
  \end{align}
$$
Thus $A$ has matrix element $\braket{w_j|A|v_i}$ in the $i$th column and $j$th row, with respect to the input basis $\ket{v_i}$ and output basis $\ket{w_j}$

# Eigenvector and Eigenvalue
> By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every polynomial has at least one complex root, so every operator A has at least one eigenvalue, and a corresponding eigenvector.

- Eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue $v$ is the set of vectors which have eigenvalue $v$.
- When an eigenspace is more than one dimensional we say that it is degenerate, i.e. two or more linear independent eigen vectors have the same eigenvalue.
