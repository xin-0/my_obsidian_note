QCQI: [[Hamiltonian]]
> If we know the Hamiltonian of a system, then (together with a knowledge of $\hbar$) we understand its dynamics completely, at least in principle. In general figuring out the Hamiltonian needed to describe a particular physical system is a very difficult problem – much of twentieth century physics has been concerned with this problem – which requires substantial input from experiment in order to be answered. From our point of view this is a problem of detail to be addressed by physical theories built within the framework of quantum mechanics – what Hamiltonian do we need to describe atoms in such-and-such a configuration – and is not a question that needs to be addressed by the theory of quantum mechanics itself. Most of the time in our discussion of quantum computation and quantum information we won’t need to discuss Hamiltonians, and when we do, we will usually just posit that some matrix is the Hamiltonian as a starting point, and proceed from there, without attempting to justify the use of that Hamiltonian.
