DNA computer for solving Hamiltonian path in Directed Graph:
- Parallelism
- still the same computational power as Turing Machine.
- Can handle up to graph with several dozens of vertices.

Noise prevent analogue computer from having infinite distinguishable state

Parallelism can decrease the effect of noise because effects of noise have less time to accumulate.

_communication complexity_ is developed to solve issues in distributed computation
> When quantum resources are available and can be exchanged between distributed computers, the communication costs can sometimes be greatly reduced.
