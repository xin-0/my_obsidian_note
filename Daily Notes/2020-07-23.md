reading notes on [[2020-07-22]]'s Quantum computation and Quantum Information:
#### 1.2 p. 16
> But an even more interesting question to ask might be: how much information is represented by a qubit if we do not measure it? This is a trick question, because how can one quantify information if it cannot be measured? Nevertheless, there is something conceptually important here, because when Nature evolves a closed quantum system of qubits, not performing any ‘measurements’, she apparently does keep track of all the continuous variables describing the state, like α and β. In a sense, in the state of a qubit, Nature conceals a great deal of ‘hidden information’. And even more interestingly, we will see shortly that the potential amount of this extra ‘information’ grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Understanding this hidden quantum information is a question that we grapple with for much of this book, and which lies at the heart of what makes quantum mechanics a powerful tool for information processing.

#### 1.2.1 p17
> For n = 500 this number is larger than the estimated number of atoms in the Universe! ...
> It is as if Nature were keeping 2 500 hidden pieces of scratch paper on the side, on which she performs her calculations as the system evolves

#### 1.3
- Quantum computation is the language used to describe changes occuring to a quantum state.
- quantum gates act "linearly":
	> nonlinear behavior can lead to apparent paradoxes such as time travel, faster-than-light communication, and violations of the second laws of thermodynamics

#### 1.3.1
Decomposing single qubit operations, arbitrary single qubit quantum logic gate:
$$
U=e^{i\alpha}\begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\beta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\beta/2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \cos{\gamma\over2} & -\sin{\gamma\over2} \\ \sin{\gamma\over2} & \cos{\gamma\over2}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\delta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\delta/2}\end{bmatrix}
$$
$\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are real

#### 1.3.2
$CNOT$ gate can be seen as a n=generalization of classical $NOT$ gate:
$$\ket {A,B}	\rightarrow \ket {A,A\oplus B}$$
$\oplus$ is addition modulus 2 which is classical $NOT$

#### 1.3.4 
- swap gate
![[QCCI-1-3-4.png]]
$\begin{align}
\ket {a,b} &\longrightarrow\ket {a,a\oplus b}\\
		   &\longrightarrow\ket {a \oplus(a\oplus b),a\oplus b}=\ket {b,a\oplus b} \\
		   &\longrightarrow\ket {b,(a\oplus b)\oplus b}=\ket {b, a}
\end{align}$

- matrix point of viewof the swap gate:
$$
	\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\\0&1&0&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}
$$
- quantum curcuits' differences from 
	1. curcuit is acyclic: no loop
	2. no $FANIN$, no wire join, because not reversible
	3. no $FANOUT$, no output copy. Forbids by Quantum Mechanics. [[No-Cloning]] Theorem
- $Controlled-U$ gate:
	- CNOT: $U=X$
