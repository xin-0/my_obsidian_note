- [ ] 3.16

## Solution
### 3.15
Idea:
At each compare-and-swap step, we can either swap or not to swap the two numbers based on the result of the comparision. Thus, 2 sequences will be put into the correct order at each step. $k$ steps gives $2^k$ correct sequences at most.
Prove:
using induction.
