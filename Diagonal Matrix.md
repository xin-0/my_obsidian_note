# Diagonalizable
## Definition
For a $n\times n$ square matrix $A$, it is diagonalizable if it can be written into 
$$A=PDP^{-1}$$
where $D$ is a $n\times n$ diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$,
and $P$ is a nonsingular $n\times n$ square matrix consisting of the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues in $D$.

## Propositions
- $A$ is diagonalizable $\iff$ A has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors.
