# Math Postulates
1. To every physical system there is a function $\Psi$ ascribe to and defining the state.
	- Physical Sytem: a free particle in QM
2. Composite system lives in a space that is the tensor product of two individual Hilbert spaces
3. Every observable is represented by eigenvalues of a Hermitian oprator in Hilbert Space
4. Quantum operations and time evolution of a quantum state are represented by unitary operator on the Hilbert 
	- consequence of Schordinger's Equation
