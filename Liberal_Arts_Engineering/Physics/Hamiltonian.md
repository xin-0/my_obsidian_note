A [[Hermitian]] operator in [[Quantum Mechanics]]

$$H=\sum_E E\ket E \bra E$$
- {$\ket E$}: energy eigenstates
- $E$: energy of state $\ket E$
- $(E,\ket E)$ with the lowest energy $E$ is known as the ground state energy and ground state

Any Unitary operator can be written as :
$$U=\exp(iK)$$
for some Hermitian operator $K$

Hamiltonian an be time varying,  $H(t)$
