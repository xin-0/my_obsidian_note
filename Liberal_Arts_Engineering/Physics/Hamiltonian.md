A [[Hermitian]] operator in [[Quantum Mechanics]]

$$H=\sum_E E\mid E \rangle\langle E\mid$$
- {$\mid E\rangle$}: energy eigenstates
- $E$: energy of state $\mid E\rangle$
- $(E,\mid E \rangle)$ with the lowest energy $E$ is known as the ground state energy and ground state

Any Unitary operator can be written as :
$$U=\exp(iK)$$
for some Hermitian operator $K$

Hamiltonian an be time varying,  $H(t)$
