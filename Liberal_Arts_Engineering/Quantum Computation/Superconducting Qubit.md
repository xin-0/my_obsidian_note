Hardware(up until 2020): large and they operate in systems the size of 55-gallon drums

## Components
---
- joeseph conjunction
- islandds: superconducting electrodes
	- interconnected by joeseph conjunctions

## [[Hamiltonian]]
---
Two parts, ==Non-commute==:
- capacitive, $C$
	- localize the cooper pairs
- inductive, $L$
	- favors cooper pairs tuuneling

## Types

### Models:
- [[Charge Qubit]]
- flux qubit
	![[flux_qubit.png]]
- phase qubit
	![[phase_qubit.png]]
- fluxonium
- ...

### Commons
- works in frenquency range from 4 to 8 GHz --> $f_{01}$ 
	- $f_{01}$ is related to $E_{01}$, the energy between state 0 and 1
### Differences between models:
- number of island
- number of joseph junctions
- relative energy scale of $L$ and $C$
