# [[Spin Qubit]]

## Physical operation
### I/O
- Initialize: 
	- adjust resevoir's Fermi Energy according to quantum dot's energy. Spin-to-charge conversion.
- Readout: 
	- [[Elzerman readout]]

### qubit control
- Realized by introducing alternating magnetic field  in the perpendicular direction to the applied magnetic field (for ?). This magnetic is generated by AC current.
- When frequency of the AC current matches the resonace frequency of the qubit, Photons with  energy equals to zeeman energy of the qubit. The photon can flip the spin state
- qubit rotates as time evolves with different frequncies. These are Rabi oscillation.
- Decoherence ocurs very fast due to nuclear spin around the system, [[hyperfine interaction]].
- <sup>28</sup>Si, with 0 nuclear spin, can make the coherence time much longer.

### Coupling
Use [[exchange interaction]]
