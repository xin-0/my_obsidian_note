Quantum computation:
1. A scalable physical system with well characterized qubit
2. The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state
3. Long relevant decoherence times
4. A "universal" set of quantum gates
5. A qubit-specific measurement capability

Quantum communication:
1. The ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits
2. The ability to faithfully tranmit flying qubits between specified locations
